# EDA_data_science_salaries
Exploratory Data Analysis of Data Science salaries.
Database downloaded from Kaggle.

 Database is based on responses from over 600 tested data-based professionals from different countries
 Through this analysis I wanted to show:
 - who are the respondents - what is their job title, what seniority are they, what is the size of company they work in
 - what are the salaries - how the distribution looks like, how they changed through years, how they depend on seniority,
   is there a difference in salaries between remote and stationary employees?
   In the last part I wanted to check if there are correlations between numerical data

 In the end of analysis I have added summary of all results of this analysis
